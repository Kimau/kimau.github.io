      Finally does it need to be secure?
      
      Do you really need a handshake to get the data?
      
      What’s involved in making it public?
      
      ​
      
      The designer can loosen constraints and design around these issues, the network programmer has to just implement the spec so as designers you need to think how you can loosen these constraints.
      
      Talking to the network team early is a huge help for these big decisions.

      The 1st step is saying hello, often to multiple servers
      
      This involves finding the person you need to talk to, saying hello, proving you are who you say you are and often checking with a 3rd party you are who you say you are
      
      Typical handshake is 5-10 messages
      
      At 40ms latency that’s 200ms to 400ms with no delay, have seen handshakes take a second often in real world

      All important opening
      
      Nothing can happen until this step is complete
      
      It’s critical you design the first 5 minutes of your game boot and be aggressive about managing that.
      
      We already talk about optimising the hardware IO but you should be looking at the network calls as well.
      
      ​
      
      Often in production rush people will init libraries or services earlier than needed and slow down your initial network response.
      
      ​
      
      What is your flow? Network is down or unresponsive. Do you fail gracefully?
      
      Players are happier offline than having a poor online experience don’t be afraid to turn off network features if your servers are overheating, or their connection is suffering.
      
      ​
      
      If your 80% sure the player is going to play online can you start looking for games?

      What if… data around the user.
      
      ​
      
      To get a player view of that data we need to access a LOT of data.
      
      Sometimes making multiple network calls to query different parts of a leaderboard service.
      
      As alternative example, is it viable at the end of a play session or once per day or similiar building a player report.
      
      ​
      
      This can be the first thing the player downloads from your server, with their data.
      
      It is not complete and maybe not even the most up to data but its a bootstrap package of data to get the player up and running ASAP with most data they need.
      
      ​
      
      Tip: If you have stats, generating interesting rich snippets in this report is very doable and cool.
      
      Also think about what happens if that report is not built, for some reason what’s your fail case.

      The price war has driven the cost, espcially on storage WAAAAAAAaaaaaaay down
      
      ​
      
      These services have great automated tools to spin up new boxes as required and scale.
      
      Everything from custom linux boxes running your own C code to something more managed like Google App Engine.

      It breaks out into two areas in most cases, some services will supply a built in CDN
      
      ​
      
      The first thing you will charged for in most systems, especially in traditional server setups is Instance Time multiplied by the quality of the server instance.
      
      Costs are cheaper if you can be predictable in your usage but keeping your instance hours low is key to a low bill.
      
      A cheap instance can be $0.013 to $5.520 per hour from a raspberry pi style machine to a beefy super box and the bill can be cut more than half if you can plan your instance use.
      
      ​
      
      Storage is a complex box between static storage, big table, rdbs and such but you can store gigabytes for pennies again.
      
      ​
      
      Bandwidth varies because transfer internally is free often and external costs vary by region.
      
      Though you are talking TB for pennies
      
      ​
      
      That all sounds very scary so let me assure you….
      
      Server costs are lower than you expect
      
      I get frequent reports on various titles hosting bills and I’m constantly shocked by how cheap they are.
      
      ​
      
      Triple AAA titles with an active multiplayer having a monthly bill of X
      
      Smaller digital titles operating for an entire year on X
      
      Especially if you are able to go for a vendor specific tech like Google App Engine bills can be super low and scaling almost trivial.

<div class="image">

      <span class="pageNum" style="width:37%">[19]</span>

      <div class="speakerNotes">
      
      One common question, usually after a title has launch is why so slow? Or why is that a bottleneck
      
      ​
      
      Your #1 enemy is consistency, ensuring data is reliably the same and different users see the same thing at the exact same time, despite regions and multiple threads ect…
      
      ​
      
      Mutex is a cookie jar that most of the time only one person can reach into at a time.
      
      Your high consistency databases are evil cookie jars that your players will fight over.
      
      So anytime your design can avoid real time highly consistent data you are making the right choice.
      
      ​
      
      At all times you must be planning how to handle failure, especially in consistent data.
      
      As it's the most likely area of your network to fail.
      
      ​
      
      So with that lets talk Databases

        <h2>SQL vs Key/Value</h2>
        
<div class="image">

      <span class="pageNum" style="width:38%">[20]</span>

      <div class="speakerNotes">
      
      No going to make you database experts but you need to know the difference
      
      There are so many flavours but I like to boil it down to SQL vs Key/Value
      
      Key Value systems are immediately understood by game developers and are super powerful by appearing to be stupidly simple.
      
      You access data based on a key. No fancy joins, tables, queries or the like.
      
      ​
      
      As a designer the questions you need to ask are
      
      Is speed a key concern? Is the data realtime?
      
      Am I okay with it costing more when there is more data? I’ve seen teams bitten by climbing server bills because their data backend means increased complexity over time which means more server bills
      
      Do we need to do complex operations? For instance recommendation engines or finding out all the users who killed someone with a shotgun on level 3?
      
      Does it need to be consistent? Am I okay with two people asking within seconds getting slightly different answers?
      
      Am I okay with losing an hours data? Some data systems will not guarantee the data in RAM is safe, so data loss may occur are you okay with that
      
      ​
      
      Talk to your network guys, or the people at your hosting company of choice and they will help you with these.

        <h2>Plan Ahead</h2>
        
<div class="image">
  <img src="plan.jpg">

      <span class="pageNum" style="width:40%">[21]</span>

      <div class="speakerNotes">
      
      Load testing must be done especially if you're a console title. Smaller indie titles on PC might escape serious testing but all console titles or PC titles with a marketing budget should have pre-launch load testing.
      
      If you don’t have a dedicated network team make sure you ask for help. Amateur load tests are almost never worth it.
      
      ​
      
      Bad data will happen. A hack will occur or some other exploit and you need to know what happens when the data is corrupted. What is your plan for this?
      
      ​
      
      Which follows into your rollback plan, do you have one?
      
      ​
      
      Finally perfection is the enemy. One title I know of had a memory leak which mean the servers crash once every day and a half or so. Someone wrote a cron script to reset the server once a day. Problem solved. Not ideal but it got things up and running with the least amount of disruption.

      <div class="speakerNotes">
      
      Another problem is often your community is huge and matchmaking is opaque
      
      Here is one use case I’ve prototyped and discussed with some teams.
      
      ​
      
      Picture an arena or world holding 200 players the player is matched into
      
      There are say 30 games going on in this arena
      
      ​
      
      You can immediately see all the players in the arena, and the games in progress
      
      You match into a game with other spectators in the arena
      
      ​
      
      Between spectating, and playing a series of games with a smaller player pool you get two great benefits
      
      Matchmaking, progress and community is powerfully visible
      
      The community factor and improved behaviour of smaller communities is quickly found in this.
      
      ​
      
      The matchmaking will be slower than a global pool but it feels faster because its more transparent and the FEEL is critical
      
      Also it comes with all these fringe benefits

      I’ve just listed a few creative use cases and you should start playing around with match making as much as the rest of your design
      
      ​
      
      Quick experiment: What if all your matches started in 5 minutes intervals (PLAYER VISIBLE)
      
      It would be more transparent, easier for the player to organise
      
      But will introduce a 5 minute wait worse case and maybe cause a network spike

      The reality is you are never in just one session or network context
      
      Platform session, games and voice chat often split the pie.

      Games can use this to their advantage.
      
      Game worlds can be broken up into multiple spatial sessions
      
      Some tech does this invisibly under the hood
      
      What can your design do with this??

      For instance various matches could share a low traffic “world session”

      Getting your community to gather at specific times, this is critical for smaller titles who might have thin matching pools
      
      ​
      
      If you can schedule play though the RSVP is very tentative because it's digital.
      
      It should be a visible commitment and if you have a sweat or MTX currency consider selling a tourney ticket to reinforce that commitment.
      
      ​
      
      Also temporal leaderboards like Spelunky leaderboards are a great example of single player use cases

      Alternative forms of communication are some of the most powerful

      &gt; Context driven communication is faster, more relevant and often friendlier (Hearthstone, Moba, Left 4 Dead)
      
      &gt; You can remove bias by being careful with voice chat, hiding usernames and nationality though it restricts community (Journey)
      
      &gt; Emoji, stickers and non verbal communication can be very powerful (LBP)
      
      &gt; Karma is very dangerous when visible mostly because gamers will game any visible number
      
      &gt; Collaborative drawing in real time is also easier than most people think

      Reputation is all about relationships
      
      Graphs are a great data structure to represent this
      
      Semantic Graphs or Knowledge graph are what power searches like, “How tall is David Cameron?” and it gives you exact results as a card.
      
      ​
      
      You can build graphs tracking what levels or content people like and their interactions.
      
      Even down to ingame interactions like healing or assisting
      
      ​
      
      Building these graphs at a community level makes them infinitely more powerful

      They had a bad experience with Sam as their Tank
      
      Pete knows Sue though who knows and likes Dave who heavily favours Tank, so the system can suggest Dave for the dungeon run

      There are the obvious things like Leaderboards, Matchmaking, Small Data storage and sooooo many others
      
      ​
      
      The only way you can really be on top of this is to read the docs.

      Permanence by peers can also be developed
      
      The truth is that it already is, just not in our sphere. We are going directly person to person in a much more casual, ephemeral way which is more people centric.

      Social media was initially a very small group of people which exploded beyond our control. Most people do not want to manage friends, or complicated technical privacy tools sites like Facebook or G+ provide. We solve these complex social interactions through more people driven means. A common example is pseudonyms on smaller services like Tumblr &amp; Instagram.
      
      ​
      
      Most of all, we like to go person to person. Sure, if I tell you my secrets over coffee you could blab about them. You could record me without my knowledge, but I know you won’t because you’re my friend. This is the social contract.
      
      ​
      
      Snapchat and Whatsapp lead the IM explosion going from broadcast to direct communication. Sharing without the worry that Google is indexing us or that it will accidentally end up in your Auntie’s inbox. More services need to embrace easy sharing without fear.
      
      Perhaps the most obvious fit is a direct challenge. One player saying to another, “Bet you Can’t”. It’s a dominant sentiment which provokes response. As such, the player should be able to respond in the moment.

      “Bet you can’t make that jump” is an enticement to immediate action.
      
      “Bet you can’t make 20 jumps” is a chore, a list of things too long to stay engaged in.
      
      ​
      
      You can offer the option at the end of a session if you notice the player performed an amazing jump, lap or action. Just after something great happens, maybe you are flashing up a score or combo notice then provide the opportunity to send. Whenever you feel there is a moment of pause.
      
      ​
      
      Also, in most cases the sender got lucky or maybe spent a while getting that perfect moment. So it’s only fair the recipient should have many attempts. Keeping with that emotional trigger, that provoked response, retrying should be quick and fast with no loading times.
      
      ​
      
      Then the moment I make that jump, give me the opportunity to respond and go, “Ha, in your face!”
      
      ​
      
      Finally, this can complete a more passive challenge or leaderboard system. It does not need to replace it, as sending this to a friend is a different and more direct social action.

      Networking isn’t so scary.
      
      Makes sure your networking is there at day 1 in your vertical slice, first playable, MVP or other first marker point you use.
      
      Networking should always enhance your game.
      
      As a designer you need to take hold of the network design and ensure it fits your aesthetic, stop leaving it undesigned or just cribbing from others, take it OWN IT.
      
      ​
      
      First improve your player experience, and then add that one feature that no-one else has ever done before.
      
      It could connect a million people or be the thing that turns your experience into a connected dream.
