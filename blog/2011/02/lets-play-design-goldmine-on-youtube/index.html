    So about two years ago I discovered the Lets Play phenomnia on YouTube thanks to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Kikoskia">Kikoskia</a> and his awesome X-Com playthough. Which was a game I love and have played many times. I quickly discovered this is a design goldmine.

<p>Some tips on how to best use these. </p>
<p><b>Save Time</b></p>
My primary use is for games I don't have time to play, or old games I missed out on and don't have the system for. I try to play as many games as I can but time being so precious it's hard. I find I can watch these while doing other things at home. Also the information is richer in many contexts. Though you do miss out on the first hand experience.
<p><b>The Commentator is the best Source</b></p>
Switch Often, Sample as many as possible. Whether a game veteran or a first timer their stream of conciousness is so useful. Seeing parts of the game they are frustrated with or just don't click with is so brilliant. Also with experienced players you get so much value out of the community in such a condensed format. I watched playthrough of Cave Story which exposed me to so many things I was unaware of having played the game myself.
<p><b>Don't Read the Comments</b></p>
It's a waste of time and in some cases will make you super sad. Seriously stay away. Maybe read the top rated comments, and that's it. Too much time wasted.
<p><b>Games you Suck at or Don't Enjoy</b></p>
Well these guys do enjoy them, and are the audience. So let them get you excited about it and watch their skills show you the game as it's played by the community.
<p><b>Volume low but audible, Treat it as work</b></p>
The fact of the matter is most of the production values are terrible and the voices are not brilliant. Sometimes I hear a grating American accented voice (Sorry USA but you are high pitched in some parts of your country). Also sometimes the profanity gets bad and I have to just stop, but hey there are loads of clean ones out there.
<p><b>These are your audience, not your Peers</b></p>
Okay firstly that's a great thing because the raw opinion is so useful. Though as a designer you've learnt (or will learn) to apply a sanity filter to raw consumer feedback. Remember to apply it in this case, and if you need to learn how well this is a good place to start.
<p>Overall I cannot recommend this trend highly enough to designers as a useful research tool.</p>
<b>Question: Any other designers watching Lets Play videos as research?</b>
