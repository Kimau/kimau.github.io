    <p>The voting as it stands at the moment, the top five are.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>211</b> - Magnetism (attraction repulsion)</li>
<li><b>148</b> - Swarms</li>
<li><b>111</b> - Infinite Levels (random/procedural generation)</li>
<li><b> 102</b> - Evolution</li>
<li><b> 80</b> - Construction</li>
</ul>
<p> My personal choice would be construction but I've had to through my lot in with Swarms in a hope to avoid the magnets. Most the people against the whole construction thing are worried about Tetris clones. I have something much more interesting in mind. Evolution would also be interesting and I have several ideas bouncing around that. Infinite Levels is sooo wide open and broad there is almost no way to pin it down, so loads of ideas there. Swarms I have a nifty idea. Then finally I'm battling with Magnets one.</p>
<p> As a mental exercise I'm working on writing down a paragraph of text for each theme and solid ideas. Hopefully when the final result comes out I will be able to know where to go from there then.</p>
<h1>Kill them all, lol</h1>
<p>Chatting is one of the most useful tools out there. It lets me keep in touch with my friends and discuss things in a wonderful media. HOWEVER! If you do not have one of the following things, then it will go as discussed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Person is friend or previous acquaintance from real life</li>
<li>Conversation is started in order to solve a problem</li>
<li>conversation is started as a result of a fan site / dev site or common interest </li>
</ul>
<p>If the conversation doesn't start like this I can say from my personal experience 9/10 times you will hear the lines.<br />
Do you have a webcam?<br />
ASL?<br />
Do you have a boyfriend <br />
And a slew of other so called intelligent pick up lines.</p>
<p>My favorite deterrents are first barraging a person with intelligent questions, horny people are stupid. If they pass that I apologize and then just tell them why I did it. This does two things stops any offense I have caused and then clearly states my intentions. However at the end of the day the block and ignore buttons are a girls best friends. That being said, <b>I'm always opening to intelligent conversation and a laugh</b>.</p>
