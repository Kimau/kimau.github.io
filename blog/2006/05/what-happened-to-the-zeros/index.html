<p>Oh well another day has come in and I rocked up to closed glass doors, early, cold, and awaiting someone with keys. I must say I didn't expect to be in this position at this stage of my life.</p>
<p>On a more positive note my flight date approaches with a speed. Soon I'll be zooming back to cold wet winter of South Africa. That should be fun and interesting. Hopefully clear the air, tie up some loose ends and roleplay my [insert random body part here] off.</p>
<p>My email is acting up like a wired bunny on LCD doing time in a bee hive.</p>
<h3> What do you mean you don't have the time?</h3>
<p>Okay I need to get the timer fixed. I've been fighting this weekend with Textures, blending, alpha and shaders. I hate it when libaries are overbearing or bulky. The perfect library for me comes in two forms, a full clean source, or a nice dll/lib with include. You either give me a white box I can tweak the hell out of or give me a black box I can plug in and forget about.</p>
<p>Whats been done</p>
<ul>
<li>Texture Loader rewritten
<ul>
 <li>Implemented DeviL</li>
 <li> Singleton Wrapper class implemented</li>
 <li> Track by name implemented </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CG Shader Base Class</li>
 <li>CG shaders sandbox</li>
 <li>Spent five hours playing with shaders (learning) </li>
</ul>
<p> what's Next? </p>
<p> Turret ICE, and HUD. I want to complete the Turret ICE this week. The first game ICE. The Zombie was just a dev test. So far I'm happy with the ripping out of the system and the rewrite.</p>
