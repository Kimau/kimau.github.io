<p>The LD48 voting will continue for a while but my voting session is complete. I have definite favorites, and certain views on other projcts and comments however overall a good experience. My game didn't go down as well as I first thought but I learned a lot.. For instance, EXPLAIN EVERYTHING and make the controls stupidly simple.</p>

<p>Oh well getting back into the Phantom Project. I've been coding two things into it that have completed. They are both clean up stuff but still very important. The first is a log class which I can load and save log files from and to. As well as report information on the fly. Very usefull tool.</p>
<p>This brought me logically to the next step getting rid of the hack pointer system and installing a proper singleton class. I was looking at a refrence source to refresh my memory and I saw thread safty. What with all this multithreading the traditional singleton causes endless trouble, a small bit of code however reduces the chance of problems greatly (however its not 100% fool proof). So I wrote that into the system and adjusted the classes accodingly.</p>
<p>I've also been drawing the mind maps up for the different ICEs and such. I think I'll place a place holder UI then call it a day.</p>
