<blockquote><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6095612.stm"> Call for legal copying of own CDs</a></blockquote>
<p>A think-tank has called for archaic copyright laws to be rewritten to take account of new ways people listen to music, watch films and read books.</p>
<p>I really want to stand up and shout about this. I think its great. The British government is saying that copyright law should NOT be fueled by the industry but instead by the people who it affects.</p>
<p>Its wrong that most of these big music companies are sitting on their laurels making money off dead artists. The traditional Agent/Manager scheme needs to be tossed out the window. The don't add value to the product but they can often cripple artists.</p>
<p>We in the UK are extremely fortunate to be a socialist government because I personally feel it puts us in a unique position to interpret law relating to digital media. I remember listening to Floss weekly. They were talking to yet another giant in the open source world and once again he was British. Open source is a natural thing for socialists.</p>
<p>I think the mere fact that MP3 players, Tivo and Bit Torrent have survived the onslaught of DRM and proprietary formats is a testament to the strength of the idea. Its here to stay.</p>
<p>[EDITED OUT LARGE RANT]</p>
<p>Ultimately digital information is a purely additive substance so the concepts of subtractive materialism do not apply.</p>
