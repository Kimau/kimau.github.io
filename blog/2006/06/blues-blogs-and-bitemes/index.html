<p>Crazy Bon-bon chocolate covered Bitemes eating all the ones and zero dancing on the line. I think about what would happen if my tongue was cut out. I would talk in bloody spurts of silence. No acting, roleplaying, shouting, kissing would be handicapped.... Along with many sexual options, generally life would be less interesting. I would however be forced to used more 'printed' media. The idea has a certain morbid romance to it.</p>
<p>Oh well less than a hand of days till I fly out but still a crowd. I'm thinking of a million things I need get done, and how little motivation I have to do them. </p>
<p> There are only 10 kinds of people in this world, those that understand binary and those who don't.</p>
<p> Sadly there are also 5 divisions to an infinite perfection and perversion in the desire to delude one self to think of order. </p>
<p>There are only 2 numbers in the entire reality that are definite any other number written down is incomplete, yet most people don't acknowledge either of them, all of us are afraid of them.</p>

<p>Ultimately the world is witnessed by no-one but all of the world is observed. </p>
