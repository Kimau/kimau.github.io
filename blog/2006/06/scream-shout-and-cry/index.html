<p>Bleh pick me up off the floor and use my body as a mop with a spinal cord, my nerves are blown away feeling all from here to nowhere. I've been bitchy, emotional, and sick as a Cuban slave worker on a coke farm with unpaid vacation. The truth is my system is crashing and I'm holding it together with desperation and the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Got EXTREMELY emotional and moody and Friday, real bad, especially when you work with people all day. Cant kick the customer so you kick those near you. I got back Friday and spent most of that night, Saturday sick. Didn't go into work on Saturday. My mum caught it to which is good because it means its a bug and not an adverse reaction. I got it worse but that's most likely caused because my internal organs are going for runner up in the Swamp Dragon medical journal.</p>
<p>One good thing that came from this weekend, caffeine. I had to quit caffeine because of  medication I was on, I've changed medication and I've been allowed caffeine for a while now. I just haven't had much cause I lost the habit. Oh well I was dosed up on the stuff this weekend. Thankfully this meant I got some actual coding done, the first in two weeks. Sadly it always made me as agreeable as a badger with a thorn in its nose.</p>
<p>Oh well I'm going to plod off to work now. I still feel like crap on a stick but I figure if I show up and push through I will either spread the bug or get better. Either is agreeable with me.</p>
<p>Bitch one to Bitch two, over and out.</p>
