<h3>Claire's Notes</h3>
<p>Off the bat I would like to say yummy for Ren's artwork. Well I started Uni and hadn't been drawing a comic for over a year and I met an amazing artist and friend. Ren and I think along similiar brainwaves of insanity. we made two characters inspired from the likes of <a href="http://www.megatokyo.com/">MegaTokyo</a>, <a href="http://www.cad-comic.com/">Ctrl-Alt-Del, and <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a>. Ren and I didn't talk about it at the time but I avoided the male/female dynamic for reasons of I didn't want it to become a relationship comic. I feel the two characters are more readily able to convey our weird connection because of it.</p>
<p>The comic ran down slowly over a peroid of months and the University work became more intense. I didn't want to work on the comic myself and well things unraveled. We still joke about getting the comic back together but I dont think it will happen. Still I wonder sometimes if Tiren ever got pwnd by the skeletal goldfish or if Mike got a job.</p>
<p>PS. I'll get Rheno to add his two pennies to this page ;)</p>
