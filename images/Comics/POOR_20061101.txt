<h3>Writer Notes</h3>
<p> Set in my fav city, New Nancy, its a tale about a out of luck zipboy. He gets a chance to make a big score. However his luck as always is poor. Its a sad tale of loss and failure but somebodies got to tell it, maybe just maybe there is a happy sparkling ending.</p>
<p>I'm working on this ones notes and it should be done and drawn by Early to Mid December. I am aiming for 26 pages.</p>
