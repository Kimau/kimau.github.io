<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Set in the Drakensberg and Midlands of South Africa this tale about two lost traverlers devolves into a nightmarish trip into absurdity. Whats start off as innocent antics moves onto shapeshifters, mad scientists, angry women in leather, little green men and of course things exploding.</p>
<h3>Creator Notes</h3>
<p>Well its been what feels a lifetime ago since I sat down with my new Wacom tablet and thought about drawing a comic. It is almost literally a lifetime ago. Oh well I was young and made MANY mistakes. This is here more to encourage people with the thought of if she used to be this bad maybe I can do it to. The truth is reading lots of brilliant comics isn't encouraging for a starting person because you feel like a talentless idiot. When I saw <a href="http://www.crfh.net/d/19990101.html">Jamies first comics</a> I knew I could do it, because she has improved leaps and bounds and produces great comedy.</p>
<p>About the universe, this was intended for a school Zine but after a few runs the Zine collapsed. So when I started I was in the realm of reality. However shortly after I started pulling this into my world Channels of Power. Sadly my friends are given author credits because I was doing shameless catering to their whims at times, its kind of obvious. So well it does start in reality it ends in a paranormal sense of things.</p>
<p>I will have more detailed notes on the actual comic pages as you read. I have compiled several comics into bundled pages to speed up the process, and removed bad filler art. Its a funny read for me because it makes me cringe. I originally gave a character based on me a cameo role and she became a magor plot element, god I'm self centred. Oh well enjoy, and remember this is how <em>NOT</em> to do a comic.</p>
